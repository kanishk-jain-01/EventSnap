### Notes

- This is a React Native project using Expo, so testing will be done on physical devices or simulators
- Firebase services require proper configuration and security rules
- Image handling requires proper compression and optimization
- Real-time features need careful listener management to prevent memory leaks
- Cross-platform compatibility should be tested on both iOS and Android
