# Project Brief: Snapchat Clone for Events

This project is a mobile application designed to function as a "Snapchat clone," but tailored specifically for events. It provides a private social space for event attendees to interact, share moments, and stay informed.

The core features include:
-   **Event-based Social Feeds:** Users join an event to access a shared feed of stories and posts.
-   **Real-time Chat:** Direct and group messaging for attendees.
-   **Ephemeral Stories:** Users can post photo and video stories that disappear after 24 hours.
-   **User Roles:** Distinction between event "Hosts" (organizers) and "Participants" (attendees), with hosts having special privileges like event setup and content moderation.
-   **AI-Powered Chat Assistant:** A new feature that allows users to ask questions about event-specific documents uploaded by the host.
