# Project Brief: Snapchat Clone

## Vision
Build a mobile-first, cross-platform application that recreates Snapchat's core social experience—ephemeral multimedia messaging—while adding event-centric features and AI-powered chat capabilities.

## Objectives
1. **Ephemeral Communication** – Allow users to capture photos/videos and share them as self-destructing messages and 24-hour stories.
2. **Realtime Chat** – Provide one-to-one and group chat with typing indicators, read receipts, and push notifications.
3. **Camera First UX** – Launch directly into a camera screen supporting filters, flash, and media editing.
4. **Event Layer** – Enable communities to host and join time-boxed events with dedicated story feeds and chats.
5. **AI Integration** – Offer an in-app AI assistant (RAG) for content recommendations and conversational support.
6. **Scalable Backend** – Leverage Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Realtime DB) and Cloud Functions for serverless scale.

## Success Criteria
- Sub-second message delivery and story uploads under typical network conditions.
- 95% crash-free sessions across iOS and Android.
- Onboarding to first snap in < 60 s for new users.
- Meet OWASP Mobile Top 10 security best practices.

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- AR Lenses marketplace
- Third-party social sharing
- Monetization features (ads, in-app purchases)
