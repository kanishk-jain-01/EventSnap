# Project Brief: Snapchat Clone MVP

## Project Overview

Building a Snapchat clone mobile application for internal testing and validation. This MVP focuses on core Snapchat functionality including ephemeral photo messaging, stories, real-time chat, and user authentication.

## Primary Goals

- **Photo Messaging**: Send and receive disappearing photo "snaps" between users
- **Stories**: Post and view 24-hour ephemeral stories from contacts
- **Real-time Chat**: Text messaging with real-time synchronization
- **User Authentication**: Secure email/password authentication system
- **Internal Testing**: Validate feasibility and reliability of core features

## Target Audience

- Internal testing team
- Developers learning mobile app development
- Users familiar with Snapchat-style social media apps

## Success Criteria

- All core features implemented and functional
- Users can successfully sign up, send snaps, post stories, and chat
- Clean, responsive UI following Snapchat design conventions
- Reliable Firebase backend integration
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)

## Constraints

- MVP scope only - no advanced features like AR filters, video, or geolocation
- Internal testing only - not for public release
- Budget-conscious approach using free/low-cost Firebase tiers
- Single developer implementation (beginner-friendly)

## Timeline

- Target: MVP completion within 4-6 weeks
- Phased approach: Auth → Camera/Snaps → Stories → Chat → Polish

## Key Stakeholders

- Developer (primary implementer)
- Internal testing team
- Project reviewer/mentor (if applicable)
