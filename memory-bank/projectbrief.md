# Project Brief: Snapchat Clone MVP

## Overview
A full-featured Snapchat clone mobile application built with React Native and Firebase, featuring ephemeral photo messaging, stories, real-time chat, and user authentication with an event-driven networking system.

## Core Vision
Create a social media platform that combines Snapchat's ephemeral messaging features with event-based networking, allowing users to connect and share content within specific events or gatherings.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Event-Driven Social Networking
- Users must join or create events to access the main application
- Events have unique join codes for easy sharing
- Host/guest role system with different permissions
- Event-scoped content (snaps, stories, chats)

### 2. Ephemeral Content System
- Disappearing photo messages (snaps) with automatic deletion
- 24-hour stories with automatic expiration
- Real-time content delivery and status tracking

### 3. Professional-Grade Features
- Advanced camera system with optimization
- Real-time chat with typing indicators and read receipts
- Comprehensive state management
- Firebase backend integration
- Automated cleanup services

## Target Users
- Event organizers who want to create private social spaces
- Event attendees who want to share moments within specific gatherings
- Users seeking ephemeral, event-focused social interactions

## Success Metrics
- Seamless event creation and joining flow
- High-quality image capture and sharing
- Real-time messaging performance
- Automatic content expiration reliability
- User engagement within events

## Technical Requirements
- React Native with Expo for cross-platform mobile development
- Firebase for authentication, database, and storage
- TypeScript for type safety
- Real-time capabilities for chat and notifications
- Automated background services for content cleanup

## Key Differentiators
1. **Event-Centric**: Unlike traditional social media, all interactions happen within event contexts
2. **Role-Based Permissions**: Host and guest roles with different capabilities
3. **Ephemeral by Design**: All content automatically expires
4. **Real-Time Everything**: Live messaging, status updates, and notifications
5. **Professional Polish**: Advanced image processing, error handling, and performance optimization
