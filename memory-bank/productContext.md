# Product Context: Snapchat Clone MVP

## Problem Statement

Creating a mobile social media application that replicates core Snapchat functionality for internal testing and learning purposes. The challenge is to implement ephemeral messaging, real-time communication, and media sharing in a beginner-friendly way.

## User Experience Goals

### Core User Journey

1. **Onboarding**: Simple email/password registration and login
2. **Camera Access**: Immediate access to camera for photo capture
3. **Snap Sending**: Easy selection of recipients and instant sending
4. **Story Posting**: One-tap story posting with automatic 24-hour expiration
5. **Chat Experience**: Real-time messaging with conversation history
6. **Content Viewing**: Intuitive story and snap viewing interfaces

### Design Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Clean, uncluttered interface focusing on core actions
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for touch interactions and mobile gestures
- **Dark Theme**: Following Snapchat's signature dark aesthetic
- **Full-Screen Experience**: Immersive photo and story viewing
- **Gesture Navigation**: Swipe-based navigation between features

## Feature Requirements

### Authentication System

- Email/password registration with validation
- Secure login/logout with persistent sessions
- Profile creation with display name and optional avatar
- Password reset functionality (future enhancement)

### Photo Messaging (Snaps)

- Camera integration with front/back camera toggle
- Photo gallery selection as alternative to camera
- Recipient selection from user list
- Snap metadata tracking (sender, recipient, timestamp)
- View confirmation and automatic deletion after viewing

### Stories Feature

- 24-hour ephemeral story posting
- Story viewing from contacts
- Automatic story expiration and cleanup
- Story metadata (author, timestamp, expiration)
- Visual indicator for new/unseen stories

### Real-Time Chat

- Text messaging between users
- Real-time message synchronization
- Conversation history preservation
- Chat list showing recent conversations
- Message status indicators (sent, delivered)

### User Management

- User discovery and friend connections
- Contact list management
- User profile viewing
- Online/offline status (future enhancement)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success

- App launches and runs without crashes
- All core features function as expected
- Real-time features work with minimal delay (<2 seconds)
- Image uploads complete successfully
- Authentication flows work reliably

### User Experience Success

- Intuitive navigation without user confusion
- Fast photo capture and sending (<5 seconds total)
- Stories load and display properly
- Chat messages appear in real-time
- Clean, responsive UI on both iOS and Android

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Video support for snaps or stories
- AR filters or camera effects
- Geolocation features (Snap Map)
- Advanced privacy settings
- Group stories or public feeds
- Push notifications (initial version)
- Multiple media formats beyond photos

## Open Questions for Future Iterations

1. Should chat support media sharing (photos in messages)?
2. How to implement a friend/following system for content visibility?
3. Should there be notification support for new snaps/messages?
4. What content moderation features are needed?
5. How to handle user blocking and privacy controls?

## User Personas

### Primary User: "Testing Team Member"

- **Goal**: Validate app functionality and user experience
- **Behavior**: Systematic testing of all features
- **Needs**: Clear feedback on feature completion and reliability

### Secondary User: "Social Media User"

- **Goal**: Experience Snapchat-like functionality
- **Behavior**: Photo sharing, story viewing, casual chatting
