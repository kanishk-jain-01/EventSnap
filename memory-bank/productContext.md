# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Modern social apps often fragment experiences across cameras, chats, and event planning tools. Users crave a lightweight, fun medium to share moments instantly without the permanence anxiety of typical social feeds.

## Solution Overview
Our Snapchat Clone unifies ephemeral messaging, event-centric storytelling, and AI assistance in a single mobile application, reducing friction between capturing a moment and sharing it with relevant audiences.

## Target Users
- **Gen-Z & Millennials** who prefer visual communication over text.
- **Event Organizers** seeking real-time communal storytelling.
- **Content Creators** wanting low-effort, high-engagement channels.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Zero-Friction Capture** – App opens directly to the camera with minimal UI chrome.
2. **Trust & Privacy** – Clear indicators for message lifespans and screenshot detection.
3. **Speed** – Instant photo/video capture, upload, and playback even on mid-range devices.
4. **Playfulness** – Vibrant UI, animations, and micro-interactions reminiscent of Snapchat.
5. **Smart Assistance** – Contextual AI suggestions and conversational help without feeling intrusive.

## Competitive Landscape
- **Snapchat** – Market leader; sets user expectations.
- **Instagram Stories** – Highly adopted but less private.
- **BeReal** – Focuses on authenticity but lacks chat depth.

Our differentiator is event-centric grouping plus integrated AI chat.
