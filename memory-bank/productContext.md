# Product Context

## Problem Solved

During events like festivals, conferences, or private parties, communication is often fragmented across different platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS). It's difficult for attendees to share experiences in a single, private space and for organizers to disseminate information effectively. This app centralizes event-specific social interaction.

## How It Should Work

-   **Private & Ephemeral:** The app provides a temporary social network for the duration of an event. Content should feel immediate and relevant to the shared experience.
-   **Host-Led, Attendee-Driven:** Hosts control the event space and can provide official information (like schedules or maps via the RAG chat), while attendees drive the social content by sharing their personal moments.
-   **Seamless Experience:** From joining an event to sharing a photo, the user flow should be intuitive and require minimal effort. The camera is a central part of the experience.

## User Experience Goals

-   Encourage spontaneous and authentic interactions among event attendees.
-   Provide a single source of truth for event-related information through the AI assistant.
-   Create a fun, engaging, and easy-to-use platform that enhances the event experience.
