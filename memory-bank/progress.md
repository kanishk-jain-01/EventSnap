## üéØ Current App Architecture

The app now focuses on **two main content types**:

1. **Stories**: 24-hour ephemeral content visible to all event participants
2. **Chat**: Real-time text messaging between event participants

**Key Benefits of Simplified Architecture**:
- Cleaner codebase with fewer complex interactions
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Better performance with reduced feature overhead
- More focused user experience
- Simplified data model and storage requirements

## üì± App Flow Summary

1. **Authentication**: User registers/logs in
2. **Event Selection**: User creates or joins an event via join code
3. **Main App**: Access to camera, stories, and chat within the event context
4. **Content Creation**: Take photos for stories using the camera
5. **Social Interaction**: View others' stories and chat with event participants
6. **Event Management**: Hosts can manage event settings and participants

The simplified architecture makes the app more focused on social interaction within event contexts while maintaining the core ephemeral content sharing experience.
