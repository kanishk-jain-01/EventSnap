    performance: 'Compound indexes for efficient event discovery';
    ui: 'Professional event cards with status indicators';
    integration: 'Real-time loading with EventStore state management';
  };

  // Private Event Access
  privateEventAccess: {
    validation: '6-digit join code with real-time input validation';
    discovery: 'Database queries to find events by join code';
    security: 'Service-level validation with proper error messaging';
    flow: 'Complete discovery → join → state update workflow';
  };

  // Participant Management
  participantManagement: {
    subCollection: '/events/{eventId}/participants/{uid} document structure';
    roleAssignment: 'Automatic host/guest determination based on hostUid';
    timestamps: 'serverTimestamp() for accurate record keeping';

```typescript
// Optimized Firestore queries for event discovery
interface EventDatabaseOptimization {
  publicEvents: {
    query: "collection('events').where('visibility', '==', 'public').orderBy('startTime', 'asc').limit(20)";
    indexes: 'Compound index on (visibility, startTime) for performance';
    caching: 'EventStore state management for client-side caching';
    realTime: 'Manual refresh with pull-to-refresh functionality';
  };

  privateEvents: {
    query: "collection('events').where('joinCode', '==', code).where('visibility', '==', 'private').limit(1)";
    security: 'Join code validation at database level';
    uniqueness: 'Single event result for join code uniqueness';
    errorHandling: 'Proper invalid code detection and messaging';
  };

  participants: {
    creation: "doc('events/{eventId}/participants/{uid}').set({role, joinedAt})";
    roleLogic: 'Host if uid === hostUid, else Guest';
    timestamps: 'serverTimestamp() for consistent timing';
    permissions: 'Firestore rules enforce participant access control';
  };
}
```
