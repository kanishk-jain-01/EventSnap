# Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the AI Chat RAG feature, based on the task list in `tasks/tasks-prd-ai-chat-rag.md`.

## What Works ✅

### **Task 1.0: Document Upload & Metadata Storage - COMPLETE**
- Hosts can upload documents (PDFs, images) via `DocumentUploadScreen`
- Files stored in Firebase Storage with proper paths (`events/{eventId}/docs/`)
- Metadata saved to Firestore (`events/{eventId}/documents` collection)
- Security rules enforce host-only uploads, participant reads
- Integration with profile screen for easy access

### **Task 2.0: Vector Ingestion Pipeline - COMPLETE & PRODUCTION-READY**
- Cloud Functions triggered on document upload via Storage trigger
- PDF text extraction using `pdf-parse` with robust error handling
- Image OCR using Google Cloud Vision API for full-text extraction
- Text chunking with 1000-character chunks and 200-character overlap
- OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` embeddings generation
- Pinecone vector upserts with event-namespaced organization
- Fixed memory issues, infinite loops, and added comprehensive logging
- Automatic cleanup and error recovery mechanisms

### **Task 3.0: RAG Answer Cloud Function - COMPLETE**
- **3.1**: HTTPS callable `ragAnswer` function with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **3.2**: User participation validation via Firestore lookups
- **3.3**: Pinecone semantic search with configurable similarity threshold (0.7)
- **3.4**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration with sophisticated prompt engineering
- **3.5**: Structured response format with complete citation metadata
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Resolved Cloud Run IAM permissions for Gen 2 functions
- **Performance**: 3-5 second response times for complete RAG pipeline

### **Task 4.0: Chat UI & Store Refactor - COMPLETE**
- **4.1**: Complete `chatStore` AI integration:
  - `sendAIQuery` action with proper error handling
  - AI-specific state management (messages, loading, errors)
  - Integration with `authStore` and `eventStore`
  - Convenience hooks (`useAIMessages`, `useIsLoadingAI`, `useAIError`)
- **4.2**: Updated chat composer to single input field (already complete)
- **4.3**: Polished AI response rendering:
  - `AIMessageBubble` component with distinct styling and AI branding
  - `CitationLink` component with numbered citations and excerpts
  - Updated `AiChatScreen` with real AI functionality replacing placeholders
- **4.4**: Enhanced loading and error states:
  - Multi-phase loading indicators ("Searching documents...", "AI is analyzing...")
  - Comprehensive error handling with retry functionality
  - Input validation with character counting and real-time feedback
  - Visual state management throughout the user journey

## Current System Capabilities

The AI Chat RAG system now provides:

### **End-to-End Document Intelligence**
- Documents uploaded by hosts are automatically processed and vectorized
- Users can ask natural language questions about event documents
- AI provides factual answers with direct citations to source material
- Event-scoped search ensures privacy and relevance

### **Production-Ready UI/UX**
- Conversational chat interface with distinct AI styling
- Loading states with contextual messages
- Error handling with user-friendly retry options
- Input validation and character limits
- Clickable citations (navigation coming in Task 5.0)

### **Robust Architecture**
- Type-safe integration between frontend and backend
- Comprehensive error handling at every layer
- Scalable vector search with Pinecone namespaces
- Secure authentication and authorization chain

## What's Left to Build

### **Task 5.0: Document Browser & Citation Interaction - NEXT**
- `DocumentListScreen` for browsing uploaded documents
- Document viewer for PDFs and images
- Citation click navigation to source documents
- Document management interface for hosts

## Technical Achievements

### **Infrastructure Solved**
- ✅ Firebase Cloud Functions Gen 2 deployment
- ✅ Cloud Run IAM permissions for callable functions
- ✅ Pinecone integration with proper namespacing
- ✅ OpenAI API integration with rate limiting considerations
- ✅ Memory management for large document processing

### **User Experience Delivered**
- ✅ Intuitive chat interface for document Q&A
- ✅ Real-time loading feedback
- ✅ Error states with actionable recovery options
- ✅ Input validation and guidance
- ✅ Citation display with source attribution

### **Performance & Scalability**
- ✅ Event-isolated vector search
- ✅ Configurable similarity thresholds
- ✅ Efficient text chunking and embedding
- ✅ Optimized Cloud Function memory allocation
- ✅ Proper cleanup and resource management

## Known Considerations

- **AI Response Strictness**: Currently using 0.7 similarity threshold - can be tuned for broader or more focused responses
- **Response Time**: 3-5 seconds typical for RAG pipeline (embedding generation + vector search + LLM inference)
- **Document Types**: Currently supports PDFs and images with OCR - could extend to more formats
- **Citation Granularity**: Citations reference document chunks - could be enhanced with page/section specificity
