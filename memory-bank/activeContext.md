# Active Context: Event-Driven Networking Platform

## üéâ **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED** - Phase 5.0 Event Content System Implementation! (2025-01-03)

**COMPLETED TODAY**: **Phase 5.0 ‚Äì Event Stories, Snaps & Feed Adaptation** - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** ‚úÖ (3/6 tasks)

### üöÄ **Today's Major Architecture Implementation**

**‚úÖ Phase 5.0: Event Stories, Snaps & Feed Adaptation - 50% COMPLETE (3/6 tasks)**

### **Complete Event-Scoped Content Architecture**

**Achievement**: Event-centric content system with role-based permissions and real-time updates

#### ‚úÖ **Task 5.1: Create EventFeedScreen - COMPLETED**
- **Event-Scoped Feed**: Main content consumption screen combining stories and snaps
- **Creative Light Theme Integration**: Full EventSnap branding with purple/pink theme
- **Role-Aware UI**: Different interface for Host vs Guest with appropriate messaging
- **Unified Content Display**: Horizontal story scroll + vertical snap list in single screen
- **Real-time Updates**: Live content feed with pull-to-refresh functionality
- **Navigation Integration**: Seamless transitions to StoryViewer and SnapViewer screens
- **Professional Design**: Clean, modern interface appropriate for business events

#### ‚úÖ **Task 5.2: Update storyStore & Firestore queries - COMPLETED**
- **Event-Scoped Story Creation**: Enhanced `createStory` method with optional `eventId` parameter
- **Database-Level Filtering**: `getActiveStoriesForEvent` and `subscribeToStoriesForEvent` methods
- **Real-time Event Stories**: Live story updates scoped to specific events
- **StoryStore Enhancement**: Added `loadStoriesForEvent` and `subscribeToStoriesForEvent` methods
- **Performance Optimization**: Server-side filtering eliminates client-side processing
- **EventFeedScreen Integration**: Switched from general to event-scoped story methods

#### ‚úÖ **Task 5.3: Update snapStore & Firestore queries with Host-only posting - COMPLETED**
- **Host-Only Snap Creation**: `createEventSnap` method with role validation at service level
- **Automatic Participant Discovery**: Event snaps sent to all participants via batch writes
- **Event-Scoped Snap Queries**: `getReceivedSnapsForEvent` and `subscribeToReceivedSnapsForEvent`
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Host can send event snaps, guests receive-only
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Clear error messages for unauthorized snap attempts
- **SnapStore Enhancement**: Added `sendEventSnap`, `loadReceivedSnapsForEvent`, `subscribeToReceivedSnapsForEvent`
- **Database Performance**: Compound indexes for efficient event-scoped queries

### üé® **Technical Architecture Achieved**

#### **Event-Scoped Content System**
```typescript
// Complete event-centric content architecture
interface EventContentSystem {
  // Stories: Event participants can view all event stories
  stories: {
    creation: 'Any participant can post stories to event'
    consumption: 'All event participants see event stories'
    expiration: '24 hours after event ends'
    filtering: 'Database-level event scoping'
  }
  
  // Snaps: Host-controlled broadcasting system
  snaps: {
    creation: 'Only event hosts can send event snaps'
    distribution: 'Automatic delivery to all participants'
    validation: 'Service-level role checking'
    targeting: 'Batch writes for participant discovery'
  }
  
  // Feed: Unified consumption interface
  feed: {
    display: 'Stories (horizontal) + Snaps (vertical)'
    updates: 'Real-time subscriptions to event content'
    theme: 'Creative Light Theme throughout'
    roles: 'Host vs Guest UI differentiation'
  }
}
```

#### **Role-Based Permission Architecture**
```typescript
// Comprehensive role system implementation
interface RoleBasedPermissions {
  host: {
    stories: 'Can post stories to event'
    snaps: 'Can send event snaps to all participants'
    content: 'Full creation and consumption access'
    ui: 'Host-specific messaging and controls'
  }
  
  guest: {
    stories: 'Can post stories to event'
    snaps: 'Receive-only for event snaps'
    content: 'Creation limited, full consumption'
    ui: 'Guest-appropriate interface elements'
  }
}
```
