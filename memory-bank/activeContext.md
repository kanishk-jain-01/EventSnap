# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED:** Successfully **replaced automated event cleanup with manual host-controlled event ending**. Implemented comprehensive Event Management screen with complete data deletion capabilities including Pinecone vectors, Firebase Storage files, and Firestore documents.

## Recent Accomplishments (Current Session)

### Guest Leave Event Feature - COMPLETE ✅

**New Leave Event Functionality:**
- **Added `leaveEvent` method** to EventStore with proper error handling and state management
- **Created `leaveEvent` service method** in FirestoreService to handle participant removal and user profile updates
- **Added Leave Event button** to ProfileScreen for guests with confirmation dialog
- **Integrated with existing navigation flow**: Users are automatically redirected to EventSelectionScreen when activeEventId becomes null
- **Complete state synchronization**: Clears both EventStore and AuthStore state when leaving event
- **User-friendly confirmation**: Shows clear warning about needing to rejoin with event code

**Implementation Details:**
- **Database Operations**: Removes user from event participants collection and clears activeEventId/eventRole in user document
- **State Management**: Properly clears local event state and updates auth store for immediate UI response
- **Navigation Flow**: Leverages existing AppNavigator logic that redirects to EventSelectionScreen when no active event
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages
- **UI/UX**: Leave Event button placed in the event information card (under "View Documents") for better visibility and accessibility, only shown to guests, with danger styling and confirmation dialog
- **Added Logout Button**: Added logout functionality to EventSelectionScreen (welcome page) for users who want to switch accounts

### UI Theme Consistency Fix - COMPLETE ✅

**Fixed Dark Theme Headers:**
- **Updated MainNavigator**: Replaced hardcoded dark theme colors (`#1F1F1F`, `#FFFFFF`, `#FFFC00`) with dynamic theme colors
- **Screens Fixed**: UserSearchScreen, UserProfileScreen, HostListScreen, and DocumentUploadScreen now use proper theme styling
- **Dynamic Colors**: Headers now use `colors.surface`, `colors.textPrimary`, and `colors.primary` for consistent theming
- **Theme Integration**: All navigation headers now properly integrate with the app's theme system

### Event Management System Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**New Event Management Screen:**
- **Created `EventManagementScreen.tsx`** with comprehensive event management interface
- **Event Details Display**: Shows event name, dates, and host/guest role
- **Event Codes Section**: Displays both Join Code (6-digit) and Host Code (8-digit) with share functionality
- **End Event Functionality**: Host-only "Danger Zone" with confirmation dialog for permanent event deletion
- **Navigation Integration**: Added to MainNavigator with proper TypeScript types

**Manual Event Deletion System:**
- **Created `endEvent` Cloud Function** with complete data cleanup:
  - Clears `activeEventId` and `eventRole` for all participants (triggers automatic app navigation)
  - Deletes all event documents from Firestore and their files from Firebase Storage
  - Deletes all event stories from Firestore and their images from Firebase Storage
  - Deletes all vector embeddings from Pinecone namespace
  - Deletes entire event storage folder and remaining files
  - Finally deletes the event document itself
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Continues cleanup even if individual steps fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Full audit trail of deletion process
- **Security Validation**: Only event hosts can trigger deletion

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- **Removed "Show Host Code" button** from ProfileScreen (functionality moved to Event Management)
- **Updated "Manage Event" button** to navigate to new Event Management screen
- **Consolidated Code Access**: Both join and host codes now accessible in one place
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental event deletion with detailed warning
- **Success Feedback**: Shows deletion summary after completion

**Cleanup of Legacy Code:**
- **Removed automated cleanup functions**: `deleteExpiredContent` and `cleanupExpiredEventsScheduled`
- **Deleted `functions/deleteExpiredContent/` directory** entirely
- **Updated `functions/index.ts`** to export new `endEvent` function
- **Removed unused `copyHostCode` function** from ProfileScreen

### Previous Major Codebase Cleanup - COMPLETE ✅

**Removed Realtime Chat Infrastructure:**
- **Deleted entire `src/services/realtime/` folder** with all chat, messaging, and presence services
- **Removed `database.rules.json`** - no longer using Firebase Realtime Database
- **Deleted old chat screens**: `ChatScreen.tsx` and `ChatListScreen.tsx`
- **Updated `firebase.json`** - removed realtime database configuration

**Simplified Data Models:**
- **Cleaned up `src/services/firestore.service.ts`**:
  - Removed `CHATS`, `MESSAGES`, and `CONTACTS` collections
  - Removed `ContactDocument` interface and `contacts` field from `UserDocument`
  - Removed `generateChatId()` and all contact management methods (`addContact`, `removeContact`, `getContacts`, `subscribeToContacts`)
- **Streamlined `src/types/index.ts`**:
  - Removed all chat-related types (`ChatMessage`, `ChatConversation`, `UserPresence`, `ChatState`, etc.)
  - Removed legacy `Message` and `Conversation` interfaces
  - Cleaned up navigation types to remove `ChatScreen` route

**Simplified State Management:**
- **Refactored `src/store/chatStore.ts`** to AI-only functionality:
  - Removed all realtime chat, conversations, messaging, typing, and presence state
  - Kept only AI chat functionality (`aiMessages`, `sendAIQuery`, etc.)
  - Simplified from 760 lines to ~150 lines of focused AI code
- **Cleaned up `src/store/userStore.ts`**:
  - Removed all contact management functionality
  - Simplified from contact-heavy store to basic user profile management
  - Removed contact subscriptions and related state

**Updated Navigation & UI:**
- **Simplified navigation**: Removed `ChatScreen` route from `MainNavigator.tsx`
- **Updated `UserProfileScreen.tsx`**: Removed friend/contact functionality
- **Cleaned up `EventFeedScreen.tsx`**: Removed contact fetching calls
- **Maintained AI Chat**: `AiChatScreen` remains as the primary chat interface

### Technical Infrastructure Improvements
- **Codebase Size Reduction**: Removed ~2000+ lines of unused realtime chat code
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- **Clean Architecture**: App now has focused, single-purpose AI chat system
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary realtime subscriptions and complex chat state management

## Current Status

The app now has a **COMPLETE EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH AI-POWERED ARCHITECTURE**:
- **Event Management**: Full host-controlled event lifecycle with manual deletion and guest leave functionality
- **Guest Experience**: Complete guest flow with join, promote to host, and leave event capabilities
- **AI Chat System**: Fully functional RAG-powered document Q&A
- **Document Management**: Complete upload, processing, browsing, and viewing system
- **Citation Navigation**: AI responses link directly to source documents with highlighting
- **Event-Scoped**: All functionality properly isolated by event
- **Clean Architecture**: Consolidated event management with automated navigation
- **Type-Safe**: All TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Next Steps

**Ready for Testing & Deployment**:
- **Test Event Management Flow**: Verify end-to-end event creation, management, and deletion
- **Test Navigation Behavior**: Confirm users are properly redirected when activeEventId becomes null
- **Deploy Cloud Functions**: Deploy the new `endEvent` function to production
- **Performance Testing**: Test complete event deletion with large datasets
- **User Experience Polish**: Enhance animations and transitions
- **Feature Expansion**: Consider additional event management features

## Technical Notes

- **Complete Citation Flow**: AI chat → CitationLink → DocumentViewer with highlighting
- **Document Viewers**: PDF uses WebView with Google Docs, images use expo-image with native performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Document list updates automatically when new documents are uploaded
- **Performance**: Document loading is optimized with proper loading states and error recovery
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation flow throughout the document management system
- **Security**: All document access respects event participation and role-based permissions
- **Accessibility**: "View Documents" button available to all event participants in ProfileScreen
