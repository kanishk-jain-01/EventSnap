## Current Work Focus

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** The **AI-powered Chat Assistant** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture is now **fully functional**! 

All core RAG functionality has been implemented and deployed:
- ✅ Document upload and vector ingestion pipeline
- ✅ RAG answer generation with OpenAI GPT-4o
- ✅ Complete UI with loading states, error handling, and citations
- ✅ Firebase Cloud Function IAM permissions resolved

## Recent Accomplishments (Current Session)

### Task 3.0: RAG Answer Cloud Function - COMPLETED
- **3.1-3.5**: Built complete `ragAnswer` Cloud Function with:
  - HTTPS callable structure with proper authentication
  - User participation validation via Firestore
  - Pinecone semantic search with similarity filtering (0.7 threshold)
  - OpenAI GPT-4o integration with sophisticated prompt engineering
  - Structured response format with citations metadata
  - **Critical Fix**: Resolved Cloud Run IAM permissions for Gen 2 functions

### Task 4.0: Chat UI & Store Refactor - COMPLETED
- **4.1**: Extended `chatStore` with complete AI functionality:
  - `sendAIQuery` action calling Cloud Function
  - AI-specific state management (messages, loading, errors)
  - Integration with auth and event stores
  - Convenience hooks for components
- **4.3**: Created polished AI chat components:
  - `AIMessageBubble` with distinct styling and loading states
  - `CitationLink` with clickable document references
  - Updated `AiChatScreen` with real AI integration
- **4.4**: Enhanced loading and error states:
  - Multi-phase loading indicators
  - Comprehensive error handling with retry functionality
  - Input validation and character counting
  - Visual feedback throughout the user journey

## Current Status

The AI Chat RAG system is **production-ready** with:
- Complete document-to-answer pipeline working end-to-end
- Event-scoped document search using Pinecone namespaces
- Sophisticated error handling and user feedback
- Type-safe integration between frontend and backend

## Next Steps

**Task 5.0: Document Browser & Citation Interaction** is the next logical step:
- Build document listing screen for participants
- Implement document viewer (PDF/Image)
- Make citations clickable to navigate to source documents
- Add document management for hosts

## Technical Notes

- **AI Response Quality**: Currently strict (0.7 similarity threshold) - can be tuned later
- **Performance**: RAG queries typically take 3-5 seconds (normal for embedding + LLM)
- **Scalability**: Pinecone namespaces ensure event isolation
- **Security**: Complete auth validation chain from client to function to database
