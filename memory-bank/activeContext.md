- **Performance**: Consider navigation performance optimizations for larger app

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Core Navigation & UI Framework)

1. **Task 3.4**: Build reusable UI components (LoadingSpinner, Modal) - Button and Input already complete
2. **Task 3.5**: Configure dark theme and TailwindCSS styling system - partially complete
3. **Task 3.6**: Create error boundary component for error handling
4. **Task 3.7**: Implement protected route logic based on authentication state - already complete
5. **Task 3.8**: Test navigation flow between all screens - already complete

## Current Challenges

- **Component Library**: Need to complete remaining UI components for consistency
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement proper error handling for React components
- **Theme System**: Finalize dark theme configuration and styling consistency
