## Current Project Status
**Status**: Production-Ready MVP with Advanced Features  
**Last Updated**: Guest Camera Restriction & Story Posting Fix  
**Active Development Phase**: UX Polish & Cleanup

## Recent Major Changes
‚ö° **JUST IMPLEMENTED: Host Promotion System**
- Added 8-digit host codes to all events (auto-generated during creation)
- Guests can now promote themselves to host using the host code
- Host code display in ProfileScreen for existing hosts
- Host code input section for guests in ProfileScreen
- Complete state management updates across auth and event stores
- Real-time UI updates when role changes (tab navigation, permissions)

üì∏ **JUST IMPLEMENTED: Host-Only Camera & Story-Only Capture**
- Camera tab and camera prompt now hidden for guests (navigation & feed)
- CameraScreen simplified: only "story" context; avatar/thumbnail removed
- Story posting now passes `eventId`, adhering to Firestore security rules
- Removed image context toggle UI and related unused code

üêõ **JUST FIXED: Story Posting Failure ("Failed to Post Story")**
- Bug cause: missing `eventId` when creating story; security rules blocked write
- Fixed by including `activeEvent.id` in `postStory()` call

üêõ **JUST FIXED: Join Code Generation Bug**
- Fixed missing join code generation logic in event creation
- Added `generateJoinCode()` method to FirestoreService (6-digit codes)

- New HostListScreen lists all hosts in the active event with avatar, display name, and Instagram handle (if allowed)
- `instagramHandle` + `contactVisible` fields added to `User` model & Firestore documents
- Host profile now includes Instagram handle input and visibility toggle (default **off**)
- Contacts/Friends section removed from profile to streamline UI
- Firestore security rules updated: any authenticated participant can read `/events/{eventId}/participants/*` (enables host list fetch)
- Button order in event card updated (Host List first)

### üÜï JUST STARTED: AI Chat Assistant (RAG)
- Replaced peer-to-peer chat UI with `AiChatScreen` (single prompt interface)
- Updated MainTabNavigator to use new screen

## Current Development Focus

### ‚ö° Just Completed: Host Promotion System
1. **Data Model Updates**
   - Added `hostCode` field to Event interface and database
   - Updated event creation to auto-generate 8-digit host codes
   - Modified FirestoreService with `promoteToHost()` method

2. **Backend Logic**
   - Host code validation and promotion logic
   - Participant role updates in database
   - User profile role synchronization

3. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Host code display for existing hosts ("Show Host Code" button)
   - Guest promotion UI with code input and validation
   - Real-time state updates across all stores
   - Dynamic tab navigation updates

4. **State Management**
   - EventStore `promoteToHost()` method
   - Automatic auth store synchronization
   - Role-based UI updates throughout app

### Immediate Priorities
1. **AI Chat Backend Integration**
   - Implement Pinecone ingestion functions and `ragAnswer` callable
   - Connect `sendAIQuery` in `chatStore`
2. **Firebase Functions Deployment**
   - Deploy cleanup & RAG functions together
3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Image caching, listener cleanup, startup time

### Testing & Validation
- Test host promotion flow end-to-end
- Validate role-based permissions
- Test state synchronization across devices

### Technical Debt Items
1. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Standardize error message formatting
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Add comprehensive error logging

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Firebase emulator for local testing
   - Implement unit tests for critical services
   - Add integration tests for user flows

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Standardize component interfaces
   - Improve TypeScript type coverage
   - Optimize bundle size and performance

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Event Participation**: Users can only be active in one event at a time
2. **Basic Clipboard**: Host code sharing uses Alert instead of proper clipboard
3. **Limited Offline Support**: Most features require active internet connection
4. **Manual Cleanup**: Server-side cleanup functions not yet deployed
5. **Guest Camera Access**: (RESOLVED) Guests no longer see camera UI

### Potential Issues
1. **Memory Management**: Real-time listeners may accumulate if not properly cleaned up
2. **Image Storage**: Large image uploads could impact performance
3. **Firebase Costs**: Need to monitor usage and optimize for cost efficiency
4. **Host Code Security**: 8-digit codes could potentially be brute-forced (low risk)

## Next Development Cycle

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
- Deploy Firebase Functions for automated cleanup
- Add proper clipboard functionality for host codes
- Performance optimization and bug fixes
- Test multi-host scenarios thoroughly

### Medium-term Goals (1-2 months)
- Multi-event participation support
- Enhanced offline capabilities
- Push notifications for role changes
- Advanced story features (filters, text overlay)

### Long-term Goals (3+ months)
- Advanced AI features for content processing
- Analytics and user engagement tracking
- Host management dashboard
- Event analytics and insights

## Development Environment Status
- **Expo SDK**: ~53.0 (latest stable)
- **Firebase**: v11.9.1 (latest)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, all types passing
- **Linting**: ESLint clean (only console warnings)
- **Hot Reload**: Working properly
- **Build Status**: Production-ready

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Event-First Architecture**: All content scoped to events rather than global social graph
2. **Multi-Database Strategy**: Firestore for structured data, Realtime DB for messaging
3. **Client-Side Optimization**: Aggressive image compression and smart caching
4. **Zustand for State**: Lightweight state management over Redux
5. **Expo Managed Workflow**: For simplified development and deployment
6. **Database-Persistent Events**: Active events persist across login sessions for better UX
7. **Explicit Event Termination**: Events only cleared when expired or explicitly ended by host
8. **8-Digit Host Codes**: Balance between security and usability for promotion system
9. **Real-time Role Updates**: Immediate UI changes when users get promoted
