# Active Context: Snapchat Clone MVP

## Current Project State
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup (Task 1.0) - 3/9 sub-tasks completed
- **Status**: Development environment configured, Expo project created with TypeScript
- **Developer Level**: Beginner to mobile app development
- **Priority**: Task 1.4 - Create Firebase project and configure services

## Immediate Focus
1. **Firebase Project Creation**: Set up Firebase project with Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB, Storage
2. **Dependency Installation**: Add Firebase, Zustand, React Navigation, NativeWind
3. **Project Structure**: Establish src folder organization per system patterns
4. **Basic Configuration**: Set up Firebase config and initial app structure

## Recent Achievements
- **Environment Setup**: Node.js v20.11.1 verified, Expo CLI v0.24.15 installed
- **Firebase CLI**: v14.8.0 installed and ready for project creation
- **Expo Project**: Created with TypeScript template, includes React 19.0.0 and React Native 0.79.4
- **Project Structure**: Basic Expo structure established with App.tsx, package.json, app.json

## Active Considerations
- **Firebase Services**: Need to configure Auth, Firestore, Realtime Database, and Storage
- **Security Rules**: Will need proper Firebase security rules for each service
- **Environment Variables**: Need to set up Firebase config with environment variables
- **Project Organization**: Following mobile app development rules for folder structure

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Task 1.4**: Create Firebase project and configure all required services
2. **Task 1.5**: Install and configure project dependencies
3. **Task 1.6**: Set up basic project structure with src folders
4. **Task 1.7**: Configure Firebase SDK and create configuration file

## Current Challenges
- **Firebase Integration**: Understanding service interconnections and security rules
- **Real-time Features**: Planning for chat and snap notifications
- **Image Handling**: Preparing for camera integration and file upload optimization
- **State Management**: Coordinating multiple data sources (Firestore + Realtime DB)

## Development Environment Status
- **Node.js**: ✅ v20.11.1 installed and verified
- **Expo CLI**: ✅ v0.24.15 installed and working
- **Firebase CLI**: ✅ v14.8.0 installed and ready
- **Expo Project**: ✅ Created with TypeScript template
- **Firebase Project**: ❌ Not yet created
- **Development Device**: ❌ Not yet configured (simulator/physical device)

## Key Resources Needed
- Firebase project setup guide
- Firebase services configuration documentation
- React Native navigation documentation
- TailwindCSS + NativeWind integration guide
- Firebase security rules examples

## Success Indicators for Current Phase
- [x] Comprehensive task list created and approved
- [x] Memory bank documentation completed
- [x] Project architecture and patterns defined
- [x] Development environment fully configured
- [x] Basic Expo project initialized and running
- [ ] Firebase project created and configured
- [ ] Project structure established according to patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity Management**: Breaking down tasks into small, manageable steps
- **Documentation**: Maintaining clear progress tracking and decision logs
- **Testing Strategy**: Regular testing on physical device to catch platform-specific issues
- **Backup Plans**: Alternative approaches for challenging integrations (e.g., camera permissions)

## Communication Notes
- User is new to mobile development but has provided comprehensive PRD
- Task list should be detailed enough for independent implementation
- Each major task should include context and rationale
- Focus on MVP scope to avoid feature creep
- Following process-task-list rules: completing one sub-task at a time with user approval
