### **Previous Context (Maintained)**

## üîß **CRITICAL DEBUGGING SESSION COMPLETE!** - App Stabilization (2025-01-03)

**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT TODAY**: **Post-Phase 6.0 Critical Bug Fixes & App Stabilization** - **FULLY OPERATIONAL** ‚úÖ

### üéØ **Today's Critical Debugging & Fixes**

**‚úÖ Critical Bug Resolution Session - App Now Fully Functional**

#### ‚úÖ **Issue 1: "Failed to fetch public events" - ROOT CAUSE FIXED**

**Problem**: App crashed on launch with Firestore security rules blocking public event discovery

- **Root Cause**: Security rules created a catch-22 - users needed to be participants to read events, but needed to read events BEFORE joining
- **Impact**: Complete app failure on EventSelectionScreen load

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Updated Firestore Security Rules**: Modified `/events/{eventId}` read permissions

  ```javascript
  // Before: Only participants could read events
  allow read: if request.auth != null && participantInEvent(eventId);

  // After: Anyone can read public events, participants can read private events
  allow read: if request.auth != null && (
    resource.data.visibility == 'public' || participantInEvent(eventId)
  );
  ```

- **Deployed Rules**: Successfully deployed updated security rules to Firebase
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Public event discovery now works perfectly

#### ‚úÖ **Issue 2: EventSetupScreen UI Disaster - COMPLETELY REDESIGNED**

**Problem**: EventSetupScreen was using old dark theme classes and broken navigation

- **Visual Issues**: Dark theme (`bg-black`, `text-white`) instead of EventSnap Creative Light Theme
- **Navigation Broken**: "Done" button didn't redirect anywhere
- **User Experience**: Completely unprofessional appearance

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Complete Theme Overhaul**: Rewritten entire EventSetupScreen to use proper EventSnap design
  - Replaced all dark theme classes with EventSnap Creative Light Theme
  - Added proper header with EventSnap branding
  - Used `useThemeColors()` hook for consistent styling
  - Professional white background with purple accents
- **Fixed Navigation**:
  - "Done" button now properly navigates back using `navigation.goBack()`
  - Added SafeAreaView and StatusBar for proper layout
  - Maintained working "End Event" functionality
- **Enhanced UX**: Modern UI components with proper spacing and typography
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Professional EventSnap-branded event setup experience

#### ‚úÖ **Issue 3: Feed Page "Something went wrong" - FIRESTORE INDEXES FIXED**

**Problem**: EventFeedScreen crashed with missing composite index error

- **Root Cause**: Firebase queries required composite indexes that weren't deployed
- **Impact**: Feed page completely unusable

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Added Missing Composite Indexes** to `firestore.indexes.json`:
  ```json
  // Snaps Index for event-scoped user snaps
  {
    "collectionGroup": "snaps",
    "fields": [
      { "fieldPath": "receiverId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
      { "fieldPath": "eventId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
      { "fieldPath": "expiresAt", "order": "ASCENDING" },
      { "fieldPath": "timestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
    ]
  },
  // Stories Index for event-scoped stories
  {
    "collectionGroup": "stories",
    "fields": [
      { "fieldPath": "eventId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
      { "fieldPath": "expiresAt", "order": "ASCENDING" },
      { "fieldPath": "timestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Deployed Indexes**: Successfully deployed to Firebase (indexes building in background)
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Feed page now loads properly (after index build completion)

#### ‚úÖ **Issue 4: TypeScript Compilation Errors - ALL FIXED**

**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript errors preventing clean compilation

- **UploadStatus Type**: Missing 'processing' and 'completed' statuses
- **IngestionService**: Missing `ingestAsset` method reference
- **UploadResult**: Incorrect property names (`path` vs `fullPath`)
- **Variable Scope**: `assetId` undefined in catch blocks

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Enhanced UploadStatus Type**: Added missing status types and proper handling
- **Fixed Service Calls**: Updated to use correct `ingestPdf` and `ingestImage` methods
- **Corrected Property Names**: Fixed `uploadRes.data.fullPath` references
- **Fixed Variable Scope**: Moved `assetId` declaration outside try blocks
- **Updated UploadProgress Component**: Added proper theme colors and styling
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **0 TypeScript errors** - Clean compilation

#### ‚úÖ **Issue 5: Code Quality & Formatting - PERFECTED**

**Problem**: ESLint errors and inconsistent formatting

- **ESLint**: Unused variables and inconsistent patterns
- **Prettier**: Code formatting inconsistencies

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Fixed ESLint Issues**: Renamed unused variables with underscore prefix
- **Applied Prettier Formatting**: Consistent code style across all files
- **Final Quality Check**: Verified all standards met
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **0 ESLint errors** (only 14 pre-existing console warnings)
