### ✅ **Critical Fixes (2025-06-25)**

1. **React Infinite Loop Resolved**
   - Removed `chatStore` object from several `useEffect` dependency arrays in `ChatScreen.tsx`.
   - Chat no longer triggers "Maximum update depth exceeded"; performance normal.

2. **Keyboard & Layout Polishing**
   - Added `useHeaderHeight` + `useSafeAreaInsets` to compute accurate `keyboardVerticalOffset`.
   - Text input + send button stay visible when keyboard opens.

3. **Gesture Handler Foundation**
   - Added global import `'react-native-gesture-handler'` in `index.ts`.
   - Wrapped root app with `GestureHandlerRootView` in `App.tsx`.

4. **Reanimated Version Alignment**
   - Locked `react-native-reanimated` to `3.17.4` (native match for Expo SDK 53).
   - Added Babel plugin `react-native-reanimated/plugin`.
   - Eliminated JS/native version mismatch & `makeMutable` undefined error during snap sending.
