# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** The **Document Browser & Citation System** is now **COMPLETE**! Building on the fully functional AI Chat RAG system, we've successfully implemented comprehensive document management with full citation navigation capabilities.

## Recent Accomplishments (Current Session)

### Task 5.0: Document Browser & Citation Interaction - COMPLETE ✅
- **5.1 COMPLETED**: Built `DocumentListScreen` with:
  - Real-time document listing from Firestore with automatic updates
  - Document metadata display (name, size, type, uploader, upload date)
  - Role-based UI with different empty states for hosts vs guests
  - Floating action button for hosts to quickly upload documents
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality and loading states
  - Navigation integration with proper TypeScript types

- **5.2 COMPLETED**: Implemented document viewers with:
  - `DocumentViewerScreen` supporting both PDFs and images
  - PDF viewing via WebView with Google Docs viewer integration
  - Image viewing with expo-image and zoom/pan capabilities
  - Responsive UI with different themes for content types
  - Comprehensive error handling and loading states
  - Navigation integration from DocumentListScreen
  - **Dependencies**: Added `react-native-webview` and `expo-image`

- **5.3 COMPLETED**: Citation navigation with highlighting:
  - Enhanced `CitationLink` components to navigate to `DocumentViewerScreen`
  - Extended navigation types to support citation highlighting parameters
  - Added `getEventDocument()` method to FirestoreService for document lookup
  - Implemented citation highlight banner in document viewer
  - Shows referenced text excerpt and section information
  - Supports both PDF and image document types

- **5.4 COMPLETED**: Navigation entry point for all participants:
  - Added "View Documents" button in ProfileScreen event section

  - Positioned alongside other event-related buttons
  - Provides seamless access to document browser

### Technical Infrastructure Improvements
- **Firestore Service Enhancement**: Added `getEventDocuments()`, `subscribeToEventDocuments()`, and `getEventDocument()` methods
- **Navigation Architecture**: Extended navigation types and routes for document management with citation support
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration for all new components and navigation
- **Code Quality**: Maintained clean TypeScript compilation with proper imports

## Current Status

The app now has **COMPLETE document management with AI integration**:
- **Document Upload**: Hosts can upload PDFs and images
- **Document Processing**: Automatic vector ingestion for AI search
- **Document Browsing**: All participants can view document lists via ProfileScreen
- **Document Viewing**: Full-featured PDF and image viewers with citation highlighting
- **AI Integration**: Documents are searchable via natural language queries
- **Citation System**: AI responses include clickable citations that navigate to documents
- **Citation Highlighting**: Document viewer shows referenced text with visual indicators

## Next Steps

**Testing & Polish Phase**:
- **Testing Required**: Some minor buggy behavior has been observed and needs investigation
- **User Experience Testing**: Validate complete AI → citation → document flow
- **Performance Testing**: Test with larger documents and multiple citations
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust behavior with network issues and edge cases

## Technical Notes

- **Complete Citation Flow**: AI chat → CitationLink → DocumentViewer with highlighting
- **Document Viewers**: PDF uses WebView with Google Docs, images use expo-image with native performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Document list updates automatically when new documents are uploaded
- **Performance**: Document loading is optimized with proper loading states and error recovery
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation flow throughout the document management system
- **Security**: All document access respects event participation and role-based permissions
- **Accessibility**: "View Documents" button available to all event participants in ProfileScreen
