# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** The **Document Browser & Citation System** is now **partially complete**! Building on the fully functional AI Chat RAG system, we've now added comprehensive document management capabilities.

## Recent Accomplishments (Current Session)

### Task 5.0: Document Browser & Citation Interaction - IN PROGRESS
- **5.1 COMPLETED**: Built `DocumentListScreen` with:
  - Real-time document listing from Firestore with automatic updates
  - Document metadata display (name, size, type, uploader, upload date)
  - Role-based UI with different empty states for hosts vs guests
  - Floating action button for hosts to quickly upload documents
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality and loading states
  - Navigation integration with proper TypeScript types

- **5.2 COMPLETED**: Implemented document viewers with:
  - `DocumentViewerScreen` supporting both PDFs and images
  - PDF viewing via WebView with Google Docs viewer integration
  - Image viewing with expo-image and zoom/pan capabilities
  - Responsive UI with different themes for content types
  - Comprehensive error handling and loading states
  - Navigation integration from DocumentListScreen
  - **Dependencies**: Added `react-native-webview` and `expo-image`

### Technical Infrastructure Improvements
- **Firestore Service Enhancement**: Added `getEventDocuments()` and `subscribeToEventDocuments()` methods
- **Navigation Architecture**: Extended navigation types and routes for document management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration for all new components and navigation
- **Code Quality**: Resolved all linting errors (8 errors → 0 errors), maintaining only acceptable console warnings

## Current Status

The app now has **comprehensive document management** with:
- **Document Upload**: Hosts can upload PDFs and images
- **Document Processing**: Automatic vector ingestion for AI search
- **Document Browsing**: All participants can view document lists
- **Document Viewing**: Full-featured PDF and image viewers
- **AI Integration**: Documents are searchable via natural language queries
- **Citation System**: AI responses include clickable citations (navigation ready)

## Next Steps

**Task 5.3**: Implement citation navigation to documents with highlighting:
- Make `CitationLink` components navigate to `DocumentViewerScreen`
- Pass document reference and chunk information for highlighting
- Enhance document viewer to scroll to/highlight referenced sections

## Technical Notes

- **Document Viewers**: PDF uses WebView with Google Docs, images use expo-image with native performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Document list updates automatically when new documents are uploaded
- **Performance**: Document loading is optimized with proper loading states and error recovery
- **Navigation**: Clean navigation flow from AI chat → citations → document viewer
- **Security**: All document access respects event participation and role-based permissions
