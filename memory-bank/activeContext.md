# Active Context: Snapchat Clone MVP

## Current Project State
- **Phase**: Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation
- **Status**: Comprehensive task list created, memory bank established
- **Developer Level**: Beginner to mobile app development
- **Priority**: Begin Task 1.0 - Development Environment Setup

## Immediate Focus
1. **Environment Setup**: Install Node.js 20+, Expo CLI, Firebase CLI
2. **Project Initialization**: Create Expo project with TypeScript
3. **Firebase Configuration**: Set up Firebase project with all required services
4. **Basic Project Structure**: Establish folder organization per system patterns

## Recent Decisions
- **Architecture**: Confirmed React Native + Expo + Firebase stack
- **State Management**: Zustand chosen for simplicity and performance
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with NativeWind for React Native compatibility
- **Database Strategy**: Firestore for structured data, Realtime DB for chat
- **Development Approach**: Phased implementation (Auth → Camera → Stories → Chat)

## Active Considerations
- **Beginner-Friendly Approach**: Each task should be clearly explained with context
- **Testing Strategy**: Focus on manual testing initially, automated tests later
- **Performance**: Image optimization and real-time sync performance
- **Security**: Proper Firebase security rules implementation
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensuring iOS and Android compatibility

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Task 1.1**: Verify Node.js 20+ installation and configure development environment
2. **Task 1.2**: Install Expo CLI globally and Firebase CLI tools
3. **Task 1.3**: Create new Expo project with TypeScript template
4. **Task 1.4**: Create Firebase project and configure all required services
5. **Task 1.5**: Install and configure project dependencies

## Current Challenges
- **Learning Curve**: First mobile app development experience
- **Firebase Integration**: Understanding service interconnections
- **Real-time Features**: Implementing chat and snap notifications
- **Image Handling**: Camera integration and file upload optimization
- **State Management**: Coordinating multiple data sources (Firestore + Realtime DB)

## Development Environment Status
- **Node.js**: Not yet verified (need v20+)
- **Expo CLI**: Not yet installed
- **Firebase CLI**: Not yet installed
- **Firebase Project**: Not yet created
- **Development Device**: Not yet configured (simulator/physical device)

## Key Resources Needed
- Firebase project setup guide
- Expo development environment setup
- React Native navigation documentation
- TailwindCSS + NativeWind integration guide
- Firebase security rules examples

## Success Indicators for Current Phase
- [x] Comprehensive task list created and approved
- [x] Memory bank documentation completed
- [x] Project architecture and patterns defined
- [ ] Development environment fully configured
- [ ] Firebase project created and configured
- [ ] Basic Expo project initialized and running
- [ ] Project structure established according to patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity Management**: Breaking down tasks into small, manageable steps
- **Documentation**: Maintaining clear progress tracking and decision logs
- **Testing Strategy**: Regular testing on physical device to catch platform-specific issues
- **Backup Plans**: Alternative approaches for challenging integrations (e.g., camera permissions)

## Communication Notes
- User is new to mobile development but has provided comprehensive PRD
- Task list should be detailed enough for independent implementation
- Each major task should include context and rationale
- Focus on MVP scope to avoid feature creep
