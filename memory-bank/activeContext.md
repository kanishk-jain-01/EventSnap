# Active Context: Event-Driven Networking Platform

## üéâ **PHASE 6.0 COMPLETE!** - Role-Aware Onboarding & Permissions (2025-01-03)

**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT TODAY**: **Phase 6.0 ‚Äì Role-Aware Onboarding & Permissions** - **100% COMPLETE** ‚úÖ (6/6 tasks)

### üéØ **Today's Comprehensive Achievements**

**‚úÖ Phase 6.0: Role-Aware Onboarding & Permissions - 100% COMPLETE (6/6 tasks)**

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.1: EventSelectionScreen with Public/Private Event Discovery - COMPLETED**

- **Professional EventSelectionScreen**: Complete event discovery interface with EventSnap branding
- **Public Events Section**: Paginated list with event status indicators (Live Now, Upcoming, Ended)
- **Private Event Joining**: 6-digit join code input with validation and error handling
- **Host Event Creation**: Navigation to EventSetupScreen for event organizers
- **Creative Light Theme Integration**: Full EventSnap professional design throughout
- **Loading & Error States**: Comprehensive state management with retry functionality

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.2: Firestore Query for Public Events with StartTime Ordering - COMPLETED**

- **FirestoreService.getPublicEvents()**: New method with database-level filtering
  - Queries events where `visibility == 'public'`
  - Orders results by `startTime` in ascending order (upcoming events first)
  - Configurable limit (default 20 events) for performance
  - Proper error handling and type safety
- **EventStore Integration**: Enhanced store with `publicEvents` state and `loadPublicEvents()` method
- **Real-time Event Discovery**: EventSelectionScreen loads and displays public events with proper loading states
- **Database Performance**: Optimized queries with compound indexes for efficient event discovery

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.3: JoinEvent via JoinCode with EventStore & Participants Integration - COMPLETED**

- **FirestoreService.getEventByJoinCode()**: New method for private event discovery
  - Finds events by 6-digit join code with validation
  - Database-level filtering for private events only
  - Proper error messaging for invalid codes
- **EventStore.joinEventByCode()**: Enhanced store method for complete join flow
  - Combines event discovery and joining in single operation
  - Updates `activeEvent` and `role` state after successful join
  - Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- **Participants Sub-collection Updates**: Existing `joinEvent()` method handles:
  - Adds participant documents to `/events/{eventId}/participants/{uid}`
  - Sets proper role (`host` or `guest`) based on `hostUid` comparison
  - Uses `serverTimestamp()` for `joinedAt` field
- **EventSelectionScreen Integration**: Updated to use `joinEventByCode()` for private event joining

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.4: Integrate Selection Screen into Auth Flow - COMPLETED TODAY**

- **AppNavigator Enhancement**: Updated to check both authentication AND active event status
- **Event-Aware Navigation**: Authenticated users without activeEvent ‚Üí EventSelectionScreen
- **Navigation Type Updates**: Added EventSelection and EventSetup to RootStackParamList
- **EventSelectionScreen Integration**: Updated navigation type from AuthStackParamList to RootStackParamList

- **Seamless Experience**: Removed manual navigation calls since AppNavigator handles the flow

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.5: Persist Last ActiveEvent in AsyncStorage - COMPLETED TODAY**

- **EventStore Persistence**: Enhanced with comprehensive AsyncStorage integration
  - `initializeEventStore()`: Loads persisted events on app start
  - `_saveActiveEventToStorage()`: Saves events whenever they change

  - `isInitialized`: Tracks store initialization state
- **Smart Event Validation**: Comprehensive validation system
  - Checks if events are expired (24 hours after end time)
  - Verifies events still exist in Firestore
  - Confirms user is still a participant
  - Handles network errors gracefully by using cached data

### üèóÔ∏è **Complete Event Onboarding Architecture**

#### **Seamless Auth & Event Flow**

```typescript
// Complete onboarding flow
interface EventOnboardingFlow {
  appLaunch: {
    authLoading: 'Check authentication status';
    authenticated: 'Initialize event store from AsyncStorage';
    eventCheck: 'Validate cached event if exists';
    navigation: 'Redirect based on auth + event status';
  };

  navigationLogic: {
    unauthenticated: 'AuthNavigator (Login/Register)';
    authenticatedNoEvent: 'EventSelectionScreen';
    authenticatedWithEvent: 'MainNavigator with role-based features';
  };

  eventPersistence: {
    storage: 'AsyncStorage with validation';
    expiration: 'Smart cleanup of expired events';
    validation: 'Firestore existence and participant checks';
    networkHandling: 'Graceful offline fallback to cached data';
  };
}
```

#### **Role-Based User Experience**

```typescript
// Complete role-based UI system
interface RoleBasedExperience {
  navigation: {
    tabLabels: 'Host: "Camera", Guest: "View Only"';
    tabIcons: 'Crown (üëë) for hosts, standard icons for guests';
    profileTab: '"Host Profile" vs "Profile"';
  };

  profileScreen: {
    roleBadge: '"Event Host" or "Event Guest" status indicator';
    eventCard: 'Event details with status and information';
    hostFeatures: '"Manage Event" button, full contact access';
    guestFeatures: 'Limited contacts (5), read-only features';
    conditionalFeatures: 'Find Friends only for hosts or non-event users';
  };

  permissions: {
    eventManagement: 'Host-only event setup and management';
    contentCreation: 'Role-based content permissions';
    socialFeatures: 'Tiered access based on role';
  };
}
```

#### **AsyncStorage Persistence System**

```typescript
// Comprehensive event persistence
interface EventPersistenceSystem {
  initialization: {
    timing: 'When user is authenticated in AppNavigator';
    validation: 'Comprehensive event and participant validation';
    fallback: 'Graceful handling of invalid or expired events';
  };

  validation: {
    expiration: '24 hours after event end time';
    existence: 'Firestore event document validation';
    participation: 'User still in participants sub-collection';
    network: 'Offline-friendly with cached data fallback';
  };

  cleanup: {
    logout: 'Clear AsyncStorage when user logs out';
    expiration: 'Automatic removal of expired events';
    errors: 'Clear invalid events with user notification';
  };
}
```
