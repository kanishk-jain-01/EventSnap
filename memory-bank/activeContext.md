# Active Context: Snapchat Clone MVP

## Current Project State

- **Phase**: Foundation Setup (Task 1.0) - 4/9 sub-tasks completed
- **Status**: Firebase project configured, linting and type checking established
- **Developer Level**: Beginner to mobile app development
- **Priority**: Task 1.5 - Install and configure project dependencies

## Immediate Focus

1. **Dependency Installation**: Add Firebase, Zustand, React Navigation, NativeWind
2. **Project Structure**: Establish src folder organization per system patterns
3. **Basic Configuration**: Connect Firebase SDK to React Native app
4. **Development Workflow**: Leverage new linting and type checking setup

## Recent Achievements

- **Firebase Project**: ✅ Created 'snapchat-clone-mvp' with all required services
- **Firebase Services**: ✅ Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB, and Storage configured
- **Security Rules**: ✅ Comprehensive rules deployed for all services
- **Firebase Configuration**: ✅ `firebase.config.js` created with SDK setup
- **Code Quality Tools**: ✅ ESLint v9, Prettier, and TypeScript checking configured
- **Development Workflow**: ✅ Professional-grade linting and formatting established

## Active Considerations

- **Dependencies Installation**: Need Firebase SDK, Zustand, React Navigation, NativeWind
- **Project Structure**: Ready to implement src/ folder organization
- **Code Quality**: Established workflow with lint, format, and type-check commands
- **Firebase Integration**: Configuration ready, need to connect to React Native

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Task 1.5**: Install and configure project dependencies (Firebase SDK, state management, navigation)
2. **Task 1.6**: Set up basic project structure with src folders
3. **Task 1.7**: Test Firebase SDK integration with React Native
4. **Task 1.8**: Configure TailwindCSS + NativeWind for styling

## Current Challenges

- **Dependency Management**: Ensuring compatible versions across Firebase, React Native, and other packages
- **Project Structure**: Implementing clean architecture patterns from system design
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying Firebase services work with React Native
- **Development Setup**: Configuring simulator/device for testing

## Development Environment Status

- **Node.js**: ✅ v20.11.1 installed and verified
- **Expo CLI**: ✅ v0.24.15 installed and working
- **Firebase CLI**: ✅ v14.8.0 installed and configured
- **Expo Project**: ✅ Created with TypeScript template
- **Firebase Project**: ✅ 'snapchat-clone-mvp' created and configured
- **Code Quality**: ✅ ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checking setup
- **Development Device**: ❌ Not yet configured (simulator/physical device)

## Code Quality Workflow

- **Linting**: `npm run lint` - ESLint with TypeScript support
- **Formatting**: `npm run format` - Prettier code formatting
- **Type Checking**: `npm run type-check` - TypeScript validation
- **Complete Check**: `npm run check-all` - All quality checks
- **Auto-fix**: `npm run lint:fix` - Automatic issue resolution

## Firebase Services Status

- **Authentication**: ✅ Email/password provider enabled
- **Firestore**: ✅ Database configured with security rules
- **Realtime Database**: ✅ Chat infrastructure ready
- **Storage**: ✅ Image storage configured with user folder isolation
- **Security Rules**: ✅ Deployed and protecting all services

## Success Indicators for Current Phase
