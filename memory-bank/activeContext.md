- Automated cleanup services via Firebase Functions
- Progressive image upload with CDN delivery

### ðŸ”„ In Progress Features

#### 1. Stories System
- Basic story structure implemented
- 24-hour expiration logic in place
- Story viewing interface partially complete
- **Status**: Core functionality ready, UI refinement needed

#### 2. Background Cleanup Services
- Snap cleanup service implemented
- Story cleanup service implemented
- Firebase Functions for server-side cleanup
- **Status**: Client-side cleanup working, server-side functions need deployment

## Current Architecture State

### State Management (Zustand)
- âœ… `authStore` - Complete authentication state management
- âœ… `eventStore` - Event creation, joining, and management
- âœ… `snapStore` - Snap sending, receiving, and status tracking
- âœ… `chatStore` - Real-time messaging state
- âœ… `storyStore` - Story posting and viewing (basic implementation)
- âœ… `userStore` - User profile and contact management

### Navigation Structure
- âœ… App-level navigation with authentication guards
- âœ… Event selection flow before main app access
- âœ… Tab-based main navigation with role-based customization
- âœ… Modal navigation for content viewers and selection screens

### Service Layer
- âœ… `AuthService` - Firebase Auth integration
- âœ… `FirestoreService` - Structured data operations
- âœ… `StorageService` - Image upload and management
- âœ… `MessagingService` - Real-time chat functionality
- âœ… `CameraService` - Camera and image processing
- âœ… Cleanup services for content expiration

## Current Development Focus

### âš¡ Recently Completed
1. **Database-Based Event Tracking Migration**
   - Removed AsyncStorage dependency for event state
   - Added `activeEventId` and `eventRole` fields to User model
   - Updated FirestoreService with user event management methods
   - Refactored eventStore to use database as source of truth
   - Updated AppNavigator to use user's database fields for navigation
   - **Fixed logout behavior**: Active events now persist across login sessions
   - Added `clearActiveEvent()` method for proper event termination

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Story System Completion**
   - Finalize story viewing UI
   - Implement story posting flow
   - Test 24-hour expiration logic

2. **Firebase Functions Deployment**
   - Deploy cleanup functions to production
   - Set up scheduled cleanup tasks
   - Monitor function performance and costs

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize image loading and caching
   - Improve real-time listener management
   - Reduce app startup time

### Technical Debt Items
1. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Standardize error message formatting
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Add comprehensive error logging

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Firebase emulator for local testing
   - Implement unit tests for critical services
   - Add integration tests for user flows

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Standardize component interfaces
   - Improve TypeScript type coverage
   - Optimize bundle size and performance

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Event Participation**: Users can only be active in one event at a time
2. **Basic Story UI**: Story viewing interface needs visual polish
3. **Limited Offline Support**: Most features require active internet connection (improved with database-based event tracking)
4. **Manual Cleanup**: Server-side cleanup functions not yet deployed

### Potential Issues
1. **Memory Management**: Real-time listeners may accumulate if not properly cleaned up
2. **Image Storage**: Large image uploads could impact performance
3. **Firebase Costs**: Need to monitor usage and optimize for cost efficiency

## Next Development Cycle

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
- Complete story system implementation
- Deploy Firebase Functions for automated cleanup
- Performance optimization and bug fixes

### Medium-term Goals (1-2 months)
- Multi-event participation support
- Enhanced offline capabilities
- Advanced story features (filters, text overlay)

### Long-term Goals (3+ months)
- Push notifications for real-time events
- Advanced AI features for content processing
- Analytics and user engagement tracking

## Development Environment Status
- **Expo SDK**: ~53.0 (latest stable)
- **Firebase**: v11.9.1 (latest)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier configured
- **Hot Reload**: Working properly
- **Build Status**: Production-ready

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Event-First Architecture**: All content scoped to events rather than global social graph
2. **Multi-Database Strategy**: Firestore for structured data, Realtime DB for messaging
3. **Client-Side Optimization**: Aggressive image compression and smart caching
4. **Zustand for State**: Lightweight state management over Redux
5. **Expo Managed Workflow**: For simplified development and deployment
6. **Database-Persistent Events**: Active events persist across login sessions for better UX
7. **Explicit Event Termination**: Events only cleared when expired or explicitly ended by host
