# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**MAJOR CLEANUP COMPLETED:** Successfully **removed all realtime chat infrastructure** and **simplified the codebase** to focus purely on AI-powered event assistance. The app now has a clean, focused architecture centered around the AI Chat RAG system.

## Recent Accomplishments (Current Session)

### Major Codebase Cleanup - COMPLETE ✅

**Removed Realtime Chat Infrastructure:**
- **Deleted entire `src/services/realtime/` folder** with all chat, messaging, and presence services
- **Removed `database.rules.json`** - no longer using Firebase Realtime Database
- **Deleted old chat screens**: `ChatScreen.tsx` and `ChatListScreen.tsx`
- **Updated `firebase.json`** - removed realtime database configuration

**Simplified Data Models:**
- **Cleaned up `src/services/firestore.service.ts`**:
  - Removed `CHATS`, `MESSAGES`, and `CONTACTS` collections
  - Removed `ContactDocument` interface and `contacts` field from `UserDocument`
  - Removed `generateChatId()` and all contact management methods (`addContact`, `removeContact`, `getContacts`, `subscribeToContacts`)
- **Streamlined `src/types/index.ts`**:
  - Removed all chat-related types (`ChatMessage`, `ChatConversation`, `UserPresence`, `ChatState`, etc.)
  - Removed legacy `Message` and `Conversation` interfaces
  - Cleaned up navigation types to remove `ChatScreen` route

**Simplified State Management:**
- **Refactored `src/store/chatStore.ts`** to AI-only functionality:
  - Removed all realtime chat, conversations, messaging, typing, and presence state
  - Kept only AI chat functionality (`aiMessages`, `sendAIQuery`, etc.)
  - Simplified from 760 lines to ~150 lines of focused AI code
- **Cleaned up `src/store/userStore.ts`**:
  - Removed all contact management functionality
  - Simplified from contact-heavy store to basic user profile management
  - Removed contact subscriptions and related state

**Updated Navigation & UI:**
- **Simplified navigation**: Removed `ChatScreen` route from `MainNavigator.tsx`
- **Updated `UserProfileScreen.tsx`**: Removed friend/contact functionality
- **Cleaned up `EventFeedScreen.tsx`**: Removed contact fetching calls
- **Maintained AI Chat**: `AiChatScreen` remains as the primary chat interface

### Technical Infrastructure Improvements
- **Codebase Size Reduction**: Removed ~2000+ lines of unused realtime chat code
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- **Clean Architecture**: App now has focused, single-purpose AI chat system
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary realtime subscriptions and complex chat state management

## Current Status

The app now has a **CLEAN, FOCUSED AI-POWERED ARCHITECTURE**:
- **AI Chat System**: Fully functional RAG-powered document Q&A
- **Document Management**: Complete upload, processing, browsing, and viewing system
- **Citation Navigation**: AI responses link directly to source documents with highlighting
- **Event-Scoped**: All functionality properly isolated by event
- **Simplified Codebase**: Removed 2000+ lines of unused realtime chat infrastructure
- **Type-Safe**: All TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Next Steps

**Ready for Production**:
- **Testing & Polish**: Address any minor buggy behavior
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune AI response times and document loading
- **User Experience**: Enhance animations and transitions
- **Feature Expansion**: Consider additional document types or enhanced search capabilities

## Technical Notes

- **Complete Citation Flow**: AI chat → CitationLink → DocumentViewer with highlighting
- **Document Viewers**: PDF uses WebView with Google Docs, images use expo-image with native performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Document list updates automatically when new documents are uploaded
- **Performance**: Document loading is optimized with proper loading states and error recovery
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation flow throughout the document management system
- **Security**: All document access respects event participation and role-based permissions
- **Accessibility**: "View Documents" button available to all event participants in ProfileScreen
