# Active Context: Event-Driven Networking Platform

## üöÄ **PHASE 6.0 IN PROGRESS** - Role-Aware Onboarding & Permissions (2025-01-03)

**MAJOR PROGRESS TODAY**: **Phase 6.0 ‚Äì Role-Aware Onboarding & Permissions** - **50% COMPLETE** ‚úÖ (3/6 tasks)

### üéØ **Today's Significant Achievements**

**‚úÖ Phase 6.0: Role-Aware Onboarding & Permissions - 50% COMPLETE (3/6 tasks)**

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.1: EventSelectionScreen with Public/Private Event Discovery - COMPLETED**

- **Professional EventSelectionScreen**: Complete event discovery interface with EventSnap branding
- **Public Events Section**: Paginated list with event status indicators (Live Now, Upcoming, Ended)
- **Private Event Joining**: 6-digit join code input with validation and error handling
- **Host Event Creation**: Navigation to EventSetupScreen for event organizers
- **Creative Light Theme Integration**: Full EventSnap professional design throughout
- **Loading & Error States**: Comprehensive state management with retry functionality

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.2: Firestore Query for Public Events with StartTime Ordering - COMPLETED**

- **FirestoreService.getPublicEvents()**: New method with database-level filtering
  - Queries events where `visibility == 'public'`
  - Orders results by `startTime` in ascending order (upcoming events first)
  - Configurable limit (default 20 events) for performance
  - Proper error handling and type safety
- **EventStore Integration**: Enhanced store with `publicEvents` state and `loadPublicEvents()` method
- **Real-time Event Discovery**: EventSelectionScreen loads and displays public events with proper loading states
- **Database Performance**: Optimized queries with compound indexes for efficient event discovery

#### ‚úÖ **Task 6.3: JoinEvent via JoinCode with EventStore & Participants Integration - COMPLETED**

- **FirestoreService.getEventByJoinCode()**: New method for private event discovery
  - Finds events by 6-digit join code with validation
  - Database-level filtering for private events only
  - Proper error messaging for invalid codes
- **EventStore.joinEventByCode()**: Enhanced store method for complete join flow
  - Combines event discovery and joining in single operation
  - Updates `activeEvent` and `role` state after successful join
  - Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- **Participants Sub-collection Updates**: Existing `joinEvent()` method handles:
  - Adds participant documents to `/events/{eventId}/participants/{uid}`
  - Sets proper role (`host` or `guest`) based on `hostUid` comparison

- **EventSelectionScreen Integration**: Updated to use `joinEventByCode()` for private event joining

### üèóÔ∏è **Enhanced Architecture Achievements**

#### **Complete Event Discovery & Joining System**

```typescript
// Complete event onboarding architecture
interface EventOnboardingSystem {
  // Public Event Discovery
  publicEvents: {
    discovery: 'Database-level filtering with startTime ordering';
    display: 'Professional event cards with status indicators';
    joining: 'One-click join for public events';
    pagination: 'Configurable limits for performance';
  };

  // Private Event Access
  privateEvents: {
    joinCode: '6-digit validation with real-time feedback';
    discovery: 'getEventByJoinCode() with database queries';
    validation: 'Service-level join code verification';
    joining: 'Complete flow from code to participant';
  };

  // Event Creation
  eventCreation: {
    navigation: 'Seamless flow to EventSetupScreen';
    branding: 'EventSnap professional interface';
    permissions: 'Host-only event creation capabilities';
    integration: 'Complete event lifecycle management';
  };

  // State Management
  eventStore: {
    publicEvents: 'Real-time public event listing';
    activeEvent: 'Current user event context';
    role: 'Host/guest permissions and capabilities';
    participants: 'Event participant management';
  };
}
```

#### **Database-Level Event Architecture**

```typescript
// Enhanced Firestore event queries
interface EventDatabaseArchitecture {
  // Public Event Queries
  getPublicEvents: {
    filtering: "where('visibility', '==', 'public')";
    ordering: "orderBy('startTime', 'asc')";
    performance: 'Compound indexes for efficient queries';
    pagination: 'Configurable limit() for scalability';
  };

  // Private Event Discovery
  getEventByJoinCode: {
    validation: "where('joinCode', '==', inputCode)";
    security: "where('visibility', '==', 'private')";
    uniqueness: 'limit(1) for single event results';
    errorHandling: 'Proper invalid code messaging';
  };

  // Participant Management
  joinEvent: {
    validation: 'Join code verification for private events';
    roleAssignment: 'Host/guest based on hostUid comparison';
    subCollection: '/events/{eventId}/participants/{uid}';
    timestamps: 'serverTimestamp() for joinedAt field';
  };
}
```
