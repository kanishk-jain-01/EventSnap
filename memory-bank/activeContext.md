# Active Context: Snapchat Clone MVP

## Current Project State

- **Phase**: Foundation Setup (Task 1.0) - 6/9 sub-tasks completed
- **Status**: Dependencies installed, project structure established, code quality pipeline working
- **Developer Level**: Beginner to mobile app development
- **Priority**: Task 1.7 - Configure Firebase SDK and create initial configuration file

## Immediate Focus

1. **Firebase SDK Configuration**: Connect Firebase services to React Native app with proper initialization
2. **TailwindCSS + NativeWind Setup**: Configure styling system for React Native
3. **Basic App Testing**: Verify Expo app launches and Firebase connection works
4. **Authentication System**: Begin implementing Firebase Auth integration

## Recent Achievements

- **Firebase Project**: ✅ Created 'snapchat-clone-mvp' with all required services
- **Firebase Services**: ✅ Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB, and Storage configured
- **Security Rules**: ✅ Comprehensive rules deployed for all services
- **Firebase Configuration**: ✅ `firebase.config.js` created with SDK setup
- **Code Quality Tools**: ✅ ESLint v9, Prettier, and TypeScript checking configured
- **Development Workflow**: ✅ Professional-grade linting and formatting established
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Firebase SDK, Zustand, React Navigation, NativeWind, Camera packages installed
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Complete src/ folder organization with types, utils, services, components
- **Type System**: ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all app interfaces
- **Utility Functions**: ✅ Image processing, validation, and constants established
- **Code Quality Pipeline**: ✅ ESLint/Prettier conflicts resolved, consistent formatting enforced

## Active Considerations

- **Firebase SDK Integration**: Need to properly initialize Firebase services in React Native app
- **TailwindCSS Configuration**: NativeWind setup requires proper integration with React Native
- **App Entry Point**: Update App.tsx to use new project structure and Firebase config
- **Development Testing**: Set up simulator/device testing for Expo app with Firebase

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Task 1.7**: Configure Firebase SDK and create initial configuration file
2. **Task 1.8**: Set up TailwindCSS with NativeWind for React Native styling
3. **Task 1.9**: Test basic Expo app launch on simulator/device to verify setup
4. **Phase 2**: Begin Authentication System implementation

## Current Challenges

- **Dependency Management**: Ensuring compatible versions across Firebase, React Native, and other packages
- **Project Structure**: Implementing clean architecture patterns from system design
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying Firebase services work with React Native
- **Development Setup**: Configuring simulator/device for testing

## Development Environment Status

- **Node.js**: ✅ v20.11.1 installed and verified
- **Expo CLI**: ✅ v0.24.15 installed and working
- **Firebase CLI**: ✅ v14.8.0 installed and configured
- **Expo Project**: ✅ Created with TypeScript template
- **Firebase Project**: ✅ 'snapchat-clone-mvp' created and configured
- **Code Quality**: ✅ ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checking setup
- **Development Device**: ❌ Not yet configured (simulator/physical device)

## Code Quality Workflow

- **Linting**: `npm run lint` - ESLint with TypeScript support
- **Formatting**: `npm run format` - Prettier code formatting
- **Type Checking**: `npm run type-check` - TypeScript validation
- **Complete Check**: `npm run check-all` - All quality checks
- **Auto-fix**: `npm run lint:fix` - Automatic issue resolution

## Firebase Services Status

- **Authentication**: ✅ Email/password provider enabled
- **Firestore**: ✅ Database configured with security rules
- **Realtime Database**: ✅ Chat infrastructure ready
- **Storage**: ✅ Image storage configured with user folder isolation
- **Security Rules**: ✅ Deployed and protecting all services
